As of this moment, GitHub does not allow you to know who is watching your 
repositories (or anyone's repositories) without accessing the API. This 
website makes that information freely available to you using <a 
    href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py">github3.py</a>.
Simply use a link like <a href="/sigmavirus24/github3.py">this</a> and a 
minimalistic design.
