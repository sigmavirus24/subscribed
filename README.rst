subscribed
==========

This is just a small flask app using github3.py_ to display which users are 
subscribed to which repositories. It can be used using endpoints like:

- ``/login``, e.g., ``/sigmavirus24``
- ``/login/repo``, e.g., ``/sigmavirus24/subscribed``

This information isn't available to everyone via the GitHub website, but it is 
available via the API.
